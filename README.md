Surf's Up with Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval

## Overview of the statistical analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the viability of opening a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu, for this, we are analyzing the descriptive statistics of June and December to check if the weather conditions are suitable for this business.

## Results 
* Average temperatures for June and December are 75 and 71 degrees, this shows a very little fluctuation between these two months leading us to believe that the weather conditions are suitable for the whole year.
* Max Temp for both months is very similar.
* Min Temp is the parameter with the greatest variation leading to the question if the low temperatures in December might be a problem, we need to consider that December by itself is not the preferred month to surf or to get ice cream, it shouldn't be much of a problem. Also, in Fahrenheit the difference seems more important than it is in Celsius, for example, I would take the risk for 2 o 3 degrees, surely this is at night. 

## Summary:
Overall the weather in December and June are historically very much alike, they differ in the min temperature parameter and that is something that we would have expected, its winter, but when we consider the max temperatures to be similar we can infer that the low temperatures in December occur at night and that on daylight you would enjoy surfing and ice cream with no problem. 

Additional queries that could be considered are precipitation difference between June and December, and maybe we could look for data to consider the preferences of surfers in other destinations, maybe Ohau is not that bad but it would be easier to see the most popular destinations and just start opening the shops right there, if it's crowded with surfers all year long why would you analyze several locations around the world, just see which ones already work, like Puerto Escondido in Mexico. All year long suitable for surfing and ice cream, and also cheaper.
